The script is designed to predict sales data changes using machine learning models that can incorporate a wide range of features, including external data like weather conditions. It emphasizes flexibility in model selection and robustness in data handling and preprocessing, aiming to provide accurate sales forecasts.

PLEASE NOTE THE sales_data THAT IS IN THIS REPO IS WHAT THE DATA SHOULD LOOK LIKE 

- When you are on Train enter a valid dataset the dataset must have 2 columns a data as the first and the sales on the right, this will allow the LSTM to learn the data. Please make sure the sales column is called sales_data_current:
